Element - anything inside angle brackets

Components - return elements

Props, defaultProps, proptypes - {
    Greeting.defaultProps = {
      name: "Guest"
  };
}

Rest - ({name, ...restProps})
Spread - function Component({name, ...rest}) {
    return <div {...restProps}Blah</div> // using spread
}

Separate non-dom (component related) props from dom-related props
i.e ({name, ...platformProps})
return <div {...platformProps}>{name}</> 
platform props i.e. class, id, style, etc would then get written to the div.


Merge destructured props with other values
(not overiding say a class prop)
let classNames = ['btn', className].join(' ')
or use filter to guard against undefined values
let classNames = ['btn', className].filter(Boolean).join(' ')
return <button className={classNames} {...props} />
// beward of empty objects being passed in.  Better to use
classnames or clsx packages.

conditional rendering - there is also use of the || operator
condition || <span>Rendered when 'falsy'<span>

children - using arrays are common with passing children
<div>{['Hello', <span>World</span>, '!']}

Functions as children / Render prop - 
passing functions as children which return a value or condition back 
to the calling component
* Some developers prefer HOC's instead, it's a matter of preference

Children pass-through - depending best to treat children as an 
opaque data type and use React.Children
return React.Children.only(this.props.children)

'Proxy components" - uses a single component i.e. button but 
allows for variation by the calling component.  Example shows adding
a classname to the base btn classname.

'Event switch' - for components with lots of event handlers consider
one handler with a i.e. switch statement.  Single event components use 
direct call with => funcitons.  i.e. onClick={(e) => handleClick()}

"Layout Component" - if a component does not need to be rerendered it
can be set to false using 'ShouldComponentUpdate' but this maybe a class
Component method.  Not sure if there is a hooks equivalent.

"Container component" - A container that does data fetching
then rerenders it's corresponding subcomponent.
